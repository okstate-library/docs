### Updating and Adding EZproxy stanzas
#### Boundaries
This process begins when a new resource is added to the library's collection and a new stanza is needed or when a current stanza is outdated and causes a catalog configuration error. If a patron or library employee notifies you of a configuration error, the error page lists the URL for the resource.

#### Outputs
Access for off-campus patrons for a given resource via EZproxy.

#### Inputs
- The [Online Computer Library Center (OCLC)](https://help.oclc.org/Library_Management/EZproxy/Database_stanzas) attemps to maintain an up-to-date list of stanzas on their webpage. If a resource's stanza is not listed on OCLC's webpage you will need to [create a new stanza]() yourself.
- Resource URL. The configuration error page will contain a URL for the resource (see below). This is helpful for testing.
