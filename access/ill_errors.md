### Access Error Discovered by Interlibrary Loan (ILL) Department
#### Boundaries
This process begins when someone in ILL emails someone in DRDS-DLS with an access issue.

#### Outputs
If all goes well, this process results in a resolved access issue that is reported in the `Bad Links Email Log.xlsx` file.

#### Inputs
- Email from ILL with information on resource that is not working.
- Log file of issues and their resolution status on the shared V drive: `V:\Bad Links\Bad Links Email Log.xlsx`.
- Administrative access to the system causing the error.

#### Roles
There are several roles within DRDS-DLS, and the responsible person depends on the error type; furthermore, the error type may not be apparent at first. This documentation outlines how members of DRDS-DLS communicate the existence of an error with each other and report resolution of errors.

#### Activities
Be sure to check `Bad Links Email log.xlsx` regularly in case someone else has assigned an issue to you.

1. When you get an email request from ILL, begin by opening `Bad Links Email Log.xlsx`.
1. Check to see if the email has already been posted by someone else.
1. If not, copy the email date/time, subject line, and sender into the appropriate columns.
1. If you know the person who can resolve the problem, put their name in `Assigned to`.
1. If the relevant person was not included on the original email, forward it on to them.
1. Give the new entry a status: `Open`, `Closed`, or `Pending`.
1. Check to see if any new issues have been assigned to you or if there are unassigned issues you can resolve.
1. Be sure to change the status to `Closed` once you resolve an issue.
