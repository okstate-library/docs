### Post Workshop Meeting and Data Entry
#### Boundaries
The process begins after the completion of a workshop.

#### Outputs
The process results in completed logistics for a finished workshop, e.g., follow-up email to participants, collected attendance data, etc. Participants will clean and archive data in OSF.

#### Inputs
- Paper sign-in sheet.
- 

#### Roles
These tasks can be completed at a working meeting with those who set up logistics for the workshop.

#### Activities
1. Log into [LibCal](https://okstate.libcal.com/admin/home). Navigate to the workshop on the Library Calendar and input attendance from the workshop.
1. Archive a copy of the Etherpad. Go to the workshop website and navigate to the Etherpad. Upload a copy to the the For Participants module on OSF. You can see an example of this for the February 2020 workshop [here](https://osf.io/mjt87/). Before 2020, we archived Etherpads in the GitHub repo with the website itself.
