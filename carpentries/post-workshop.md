### Post Workshop Meeting and Data Entry
#### Boundaries

#### Roles
These tasks can be completed at a working meeting with those who set up logistics for the workshop.

You can see an example of this for the February 2020 workshop [here](https://osf.io/mjt87/). Before 2020, we archived Etherpads in the GitHub repo with the website itself.
