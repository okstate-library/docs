I will have parking permits for you at the workshop. OSU parking is strictly enforced. First, park at a meter and throw in a quarter, then come find me at the workshop in the Edmon Low Library. Once I give you a permit, you can move your car to a non-metered spot.

I recommend lots 31 and 34 (see attached map). They are both close to the library and have metered parking. If you turn south onto Monroe from Hall of Fame, travel two blocks. Lot 31 is on your left. To find lot 34, continue south until you reach Athletic Road and turn left.
