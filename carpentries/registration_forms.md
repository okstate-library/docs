### Setting Up Registration Forms

#### Registration forms should be set up at the beginning of each semester once dates have been determined. The person setting up the registration forms will give the registration links to the individual charged with setting up workshop websites.

#### Outputs
This process produces registration forms for each workshop in a given semester.

#### Inputs
The individual needs access to LibCal in LibApps.

#### Roles
- Individual charged with creating registration forms in LibCal.

1. Use the following event description for **Data Carpentry** workshops: [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research. Its target audience is researchers who have little to no prior computational experience, and its lessons are domain specific, building on learners' existing knowledge to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own research. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems. *This workshop will include an introduction to R.*
1. Use the following event description for **Software Carpentry** workshops: [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) aims to help researchers get their work done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic research computing skills. This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools, including program design, version control, data management, and task automation. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems. *This workshop includes an introduction to Python.*
1. Use the [JPEG version of the logo](https://okstate-library.github.io/docs/carpentries/TheCarpentries.jpg) from the [Carpentries Organization](https://carpentries.org/) for the *Featured Image*. **The workshop must be registered with the Carpentries Organization to use this logo.
