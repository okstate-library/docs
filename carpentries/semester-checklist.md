# Semester Checklist
One month before the end of each semester, the following logistics need to be in place.
# Logistics
- [ ] Set workshop dates.
  - We currently offer workshops just before and after a semester. We also offer a workshop during the mid-semester (Fall/Spring) break.
- [ ] Book room for selected dates.
  - Use [Room Bookings](https://okstate.libcal.com/booking/conference-rooms) to book room 206. for the selected dates.
  - Workshops typically run from 8:30 a.m.–4:00 p.m. Be sure to pad start and end times when you book.
- [ ] Set up workshop webpages for each workshop.
  - You will need to clone the [Carpentries Workshop Template](https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template) into [OSU Carpentries](https://github.com/OSU-Carpentry) organizational account on GitHub. Be sure to follow the [directions](https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template/blob/gh-pages/README.md) they have provided carefully. **Carpentries frequently updates the Workshop Template and instructions. It is important to re-clone a fresh copy of this repo each time this process is done. Don't be tempted to clone one of our own previous workshops to avoid entering workshop details.** This often leads to errors and causes our software installation instructions to fall out of date.
  - OSU Carpentries uses a script to automatically populate the [OSU Carpentries landing page](https://osu-carpentry.github.io/) with a list of current and past workshops. The script will only include repos that meet certain conditions (see https://github.com/OSU-Carpentry/2019-11-01-okstate as a working example of the next two points):
    - The repo title must follow the format `YYYY-MM-DD-okstate`.
    - Both the "Description" and "Website" fields at the top of the repo must be populated. Click the "Edit" button at the top-righthand corner—just under "Settings"—to edit these fields. Paste the URL for the live workshop website into "Website." In "Description," label the workshop appropriately: "Software Carpentry Workshop" or "Data Carpentry Workshop." The script uses all three pieces of information to create an entry for each workshop on the landing page.
  - Do not fill in the "Description" and "Website" fields until you are ready for the site to be linked live from the landing page.
- [ ] Set up [registration forms](https://info.library.okstate.edu/c.php?g=970224) for each workshop.

# Coordinating Volunteers
- [ ] Get commitments from certified instructors for teaching roles.
  - Try to get commitments before the beginning of the semester. Make sure to remind volunteers at monthly meetings if there are unfilled teaching opportunities once the semester begins.
